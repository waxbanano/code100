# Day 30 of 100 days of Python coding
# f-strings
# f-strings (format strings) are the best way to combine variables and text together. Everything up until now has been...well...awkward.

# ðŸ‘‰ Let's look at how we have combined variables and text in the past...concatenating.

# name = "Katie"
# age = "28"
# pronouns = "she/her"

# print("This is", name, "using", pronouns, "pronouns and is age", age)
# ðŸ‘‰ Let's now use an f-string for this same code. What changes did I make to this code?

# name = "Katie"
# age = "28"
# pronouns = "she/her"

# print("This is {}, using {} pronouns, and is {} years old.".format(name, pronouns, age))
# Change 1: Using {} as a placeholder for the variable. Change 2: Adding .format(variable names, commas)



# Why is this easier? Let's find out.

# Local Variables
# We can set local variables within the f-string itself. Now it doesn't matter the order of the variables.

# ðŸ‘‰ Looking at this code again, I can set my variables inside the text itself. Watch this:

# name = "Katie"
# age = "28"
# pronouns = "she/her"

# print("This is {name}, using {pronouns} pronouns, and is {age} years old. Hello, {name}. How are you? Have you been having a great {age} years so far".format(name=name, pronouns=pronouns, age=age))
# Change 1: Replace {}with variable names. Change 2: Replace each variable inside {} with what has been defined in format.( = )



# f-strings work with different variable types too: int, float, and string.

# ðŸ‘‰ We can assign concatenated sentences to variables. Watch this. We made a variable called response and made it equal to a concatenated sentence. Now I can use this response easily wherever I want.

# name = "Katie"
# age = "28"
# pronouns = "she/her"

# response = "This is {name}, using {pronouns} pronouns, and is {age} years old. Hello, {name}. How are you? Have you been having a great {age} years so far".format(name=name, pronouns=pronouns, age=age)

# print(response)

# Copied!
# Now we have a unique text string. We can't do this with commas.

# he Power of f...
# Instead of all that faffing about...try this instead.

# Use the letter f before any string with {} for variable names (and forget that .format business).



# ðŸ‘‰ Look at this same code and see the difference using this technique:

# name = "Katie"
# age = "28"
# pronouns = "she/her"

# response = f"This is {name}, using {pronouns} pronouns, and is {age} years old. Hello, {name}. How are you? Have you been having a great {age} years so far"

# print(response)
# You can even use this trick with the """ triple quote. (Remember, when we learned that on Day 1.)

# Alignment


# left = <, right = >, center = ^

# ðŸ‘‰ This program shows how much of 100 Days of Code we have completed so far. I want this to look like a list. However, once we get to day 10, it starts to look a bit messy. Make sure you include f when using alignment.

# for i in range(1, 31):
#   print(f"Day {i} of 30")
# ðŸ‘‰ Let's fix it by adding a left alignment of 2 characters long.

# for i in range(1, 31):
#   print(f"Day {i: <2} of 30")
# Play around with alignment. What do you think?

# ðŸ‘‰ What's wrong with this code:

# for i in range(1, 31):
#   print("Day {i} of 100")
# We missed the f before the string OR we need to add .format

# for i in range(1, 31):
#   print(f"Day {i} of 100")
# OR

# for i in range(1, 31):
#   print("Day {count} of 100".format(count=i))
# f-strings must have f before them or .format after them or they will not work.

# Fix My Code
# ðŸ‘‰ Try and fix this code which is full of errors.

# First, delete any other code in your main.py file. Copy each code snippet below into main.py by clicking the copy icon in the top right of each code box. Then, hit run and see what errors occur. Fix the errors and press run again until you are error free. Click on the ðŸ‘€ Answer to compare your code to the correct code.

# food = pizza"
# location = "beach"
# color = "green"
# friend = "Quinn"

# "Alejandra ordered {food} to eat at the {location} with her friend, {friend}. She got to the {location} and looked for a {color} umbrella where {friend} said they would be waiting. By the time, Sally found {friend}, the {food} was cold and the {location} was lame." format(food=food, location=location, color=color,)

# print(response)
# food = "pizza"
# location = "beach"
# color = "green"
# friend = "Quinn"

# response = "Alejandra ordered {food} to eat at the {location} with her friend, {friend}. She got to the {location} and looked for a {color} umbrella where {friend} said they would be waiting. By the time, Sally found {friend}, the {food} was cold and the {location} was lame." .format(food=food, location=location, color=color, friend=friend)

# print(response)

# ðŸ‘‰ Day 30 Challenge
# Create a program that uses a loop that asks the user what they have thought of each of the 30 days of challenges so far.

# For each day, prompt the user to answer a question and restate it in a full sentence that is center aligned underneath the heading.

# Example:

# 30 Days Down

# Day 1: 
# Amazing

#             You thought Day 1 was amazing.
# Day 2:
# so good that I bought the David plushie

#               You thought Day 2 was so good...
# Look at the common error for help on the loop.
# Create an input statement for the user to express what they thought of that day.
# print using an f-string.
# Think about what symbol you need for center alignment. How many spaces should you move your statement?
# Think about the length of the heading. Maybe that's how many spaces you would need to center align the text.

#REPLIT SOLUTION

print("30 Days Down - What did you think?")
print()
for i in range(1, 31):
  thought = input(f"Day {i}:\n")
  print()
  myText = f"You thought Day {i} was"
  print(f"{myText:^35}")
  print(f"{thought:^35}")
  print()

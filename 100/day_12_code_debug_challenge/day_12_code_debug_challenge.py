# Day 12 of 100 days of Python coding
# Debug ðŸš«ðŸª² my code.
# Now that you have learned so much, your debugging skills are just getting better and better each day. Part of the fun of programming is finding that problem and squashing those bugs.

# I have given you a few programs and all of them have a significant problem. Your job is to run the program, identify from the error message where the errors are, and fix them. (HINT: Hit run again to see if the code is no longer broken).

# I'll be honest, some of these programs have multiple errors.

# Let's get to squashing those bugs!
# ðŸ‘‰ Day 12 Challenge
# ðŸ‘‰ Try and fix this code which is full of errors.

# First, delete any other code in your main.py file. Copy each code snippet below into main.py by clicking the copy icon in the top right of each code box. Then, hit run and see what errors occur. Fix the errors and press run again until you are error free. Click on the ðŸ‘€ Answer to compare your code to the correct code.

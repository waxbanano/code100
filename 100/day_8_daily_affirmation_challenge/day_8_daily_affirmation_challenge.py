#Day 8 of 100 days of Python coding

# ðŸ‘‰ Day 8 Challenge
# Affirmations (or insults) Generator
# Today's focus is using all the skills you have learned so far:

# input and output
# concatenation
# if statements
# nested if statements
# Build a custom affirmations generator to give the user a customized affirmation each day of the week.

# Make sure you ask the user for their name, the current day of the week, and a few of their favorite things. All of this information should be used to help you build your affirmations.
# Think of these as variables.

# The goal is to generate a unique message for each day of the week based on the user's answers.
# use if and nested if statements

# Use concatenation to generate the affirmation.

# If affirmations are not your jam, then you could do a daily joke or insult. Please don't be mean. Keep it light and funny.

# Final challenge: Can you create if statements that do not care about capital or lowercase letters of names.

# Don't forget to restate the full question. name ==. The next chapter will explain this.

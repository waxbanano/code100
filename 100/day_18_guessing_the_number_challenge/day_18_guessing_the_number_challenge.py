# Day 18 of 100 days of coding

# ðŸ‘‰ Day 18 Challenge
# We are going to build a "Guess the Number" guessing game.

# You are going to use a while loop and some of the concepts from the past few days.

# Start by picking a number between 0 and 1,000,000. This will be your first variable.
# Essentially, what do you want the correct number to be. Create a variable for that number.
# Create a while loop to keep asking the user to guess your number.

# If they are too low, tell them "too low." If they guess too high tell, them "too high."

# You will need to include if statements here with logical operators. Include the correct number variable you created at the beginning in these if statements.

# If the user guesses correctly, tell them they are a winner (maybe add a fun emoji too!)
# If they are a winner, they need to get out of the loop. How do you do that?

# Count the number of attempts it took for the user to guess number. Make sure you only show that after they get the answer correct.
# Create a counter before the while loop and print the number of attempts after the user is a winner. Don't forget to count attempts using += in the loop.

# Extra challenge: If the user types a negative number, exit program.

print("+++ GUESS THE NUMBER! v1.0 +++")
print("Can you guess what number i'm thinking of?")

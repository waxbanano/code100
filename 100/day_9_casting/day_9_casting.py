#day 9 of 100 days of Python coding

# Casting
# If statements support more than ==. They support inequality symbols as well. Remember those <, >, and = signs you used in math way back when? Well they are back again, but this time they look a bit different.

#Equality and Inequality Symbols

# equal
# 5 == 5

# not equal
# 3 != 5

# greater than
# 5 > 3

# greater than or equal to
# 5 >= 3

# less than
# 3 < 5

# less than or equal to
# 3 <= 5
# This is because the way input works behind the scenes is it always assumes what you are typing is text (or a string) and gets stored as a variable in "".

# Casting is where we explicitly tell the computer that what we are typing is a number and not a letter.

 

# The code below is saying any score greater than 100,000 is a winner. Anything less, try again.

# ðŸ‘‰Run this code in main.py and see what happens:

# myScore = input("Your score: ")
# if myScore > 100000:
#   print("Winner!")
# else:
#   print("Try again ðŸ˜­")
# We crashed it! How do we tell the computer, "Wait, thats a number!"?

# myScore = input("Your score: ")
# if myScore > 100000:
#   print("Winner!")
# else:
#   print("Try Again!")

# Let's add int
# There are two types of numbers the computer will recognize:
# int whole number (ex: 42)
# float any number with a decimal (ex: 1.81)
# int
# To change "your score" to a number, we need to add int in front of the input and place the enitre input in ().

# myScore = input("Your score: ")
# if myScore > 100000:
#   print("Winner!")
# else:
#   print("Try again ðŸ˜­")
# ðŸ‘‰ Update your code to look like this:

# myScore = int(input("Your score: "))
# if myScore > 100000:
#   print("Winner!")
# else:
#   print("Try again ðŸ˜­")
# Did it work this time?

# The way the computer will read this code is by starting with what is in brackets first ("your score"). The computer thinks this is text because of the "". When we add int, we are telling the computer, "This is not text. Please convert this to a whole number." Now the variable, myScore will store the answer as a number.

# But what about float?

# Let's add float
# You would do the exact same thing, except using float for a decimal number. In the code below, I want to find pi to 3 decimal places.

# ðŸ‘‰ Copy this code and see if it works!

# myPi = float(input("What is Pi to 3dp? "))
# if myPi == 3.142 :
#   print("Exactly!")
# else:
#   print("Try again ðŸ˜­")
# You did it!

# We are casting that input as a float which means we are expecting a decimal number. The code will not crash if we put a . and then numbers after it to signify a decimal number.

# myPi = float(input("What is Pi to the third decimal "))
# if myPi == 3.142:
#   print("Exactly!")
# else:
#   print("Try Again!")

# Common Errors
# First, delete any other code in your main.py file. Copy each code snippet below into main.py by clicking the copy icon in the top right of each code box. Then, hit run and see what errors occur. Fix the errors and press run again until you are error free. Click on the ðŸ‘€ Answer to compare your code to the correct code.

# Invalid Syntax
# ðŸ‘‰ What is the error?

# myPi = float(input("What is Pi to 3dp? ")
# if myPi == 3.142 :
#   print("Exactly!")
# else:
#   print("Try again ðŸ˜­")
# We forgot the second closing ) at the end of our input. Remember, on each line for every open bracket, there needs to be a closing bracket.

# Extra challenge
# ðŸ‘‰ What is the error?

# myPi = float input("What is Pi to 3dp?")
# if myPi == 3.142 :
#   print("Exactly!)
# else:
#   print("Try again ðŸ˜­")
# We forgot the first opening ( before input. Remember, for casting to float or int, we need to enclose the thing to be casted into starting and closing brackets..

# We also forgot to end the double quote " after "Exactly!

# Fix My Code
# ðŸ‘‰ Try and fix this code which is full of errors.

# First, delete any other code in your main.py file. Copy each code snippet below into main.py by clicking the copy icon in the top right of each code box. Then, hit run and see what errors occur.

#ANSWER
# score = int(input("What was your score on the test?"))
# if score >= 80:
#   print("Not too shabby")
# elif score >= "70":
#   print("Acceptable.")
# else:
#   print("Dude, you need to study more!")

# ðŸ‘‰ Day 9 Challenge
# Generation Generator
# What generation are you a part of?

# Use this list to guide you.

# Generation Name	Starting Birth Year	Ending Birth Year
# Traditionalists	1925	1946
# Baby Boomers	1947	1964
# Generation X	1965	1981
# Millenials	1982	1995
# Generation Z	1996	2015
# 1. Have a user type in the year they were born. HINT - Think about what inequality symbols you need to use. You will also need and and () when looking at ranges of numbers.
# 2. Use their answer to tell them the generation they are a part of. HINT - You will use if statements and int for this project.
# Add emojis or a fun statement to go along with the answers if you like.

# Day 26 of 100 days of Python coding

# os Library
# What is the os library?

# It allows us to "talk" to the console. One of the most powerful things we can do with this library is allow it to clear the console.

# Import the os library
# ðŸ‘‰ Well, this just prints a list of numbers to 1,000...

# import os
# for i in range(1,1000):
#   print(i)
# Adding os.system
# We can clear the code above by using the os.system function to 'clear' the console.



# ðŸ‘‰ Add this to the code above: (remember to indent this properly)

# os.system("clear")
# Do you notice how it clears the console? Cool, right?!

# Let's try one more...
# ðŸ‘‰ For this code, I want the program to say "Welcome to Replit!", delete that, and then ask for my username on a blank screen. Remove the previous code, add the code below and see what happens when you hit run!

# import os
# print("Welcome")
# print("to")
# print("Replit")

# os.system("clear")

# username = input("Username: ")
# Wow! The console printed and cleared 'Welcome to Replit!' before I even had a chance to read it.

# Let's fix that with another library.
# Time Library
# We can import a second library by placing a , after the name of the first library.

# ðŸ‘‰ Let's add a second library, time.

# import os, time
# This library allows us to pause the execution of a program for a specific amount of time.



# The time.sleep(1) function allows us to pause the program for the amount of seconds listed in the ().

# ðŸ‘‰ Add this to your code before the program is cleared to pause the program for 1 second before displaying the username.

# time.sleep(1)
# os.system("clear")
# Try it out with other amounts of time and see what happens.

# ðŸ‘‰ Day 26 Challenge
# Play a song from this repl and build a menu to go with it. Make it look like an iPod!

# Use a while true loop to create a title for a music player.
# Allow the user to select to play a song and use subroutine called 'play' when they select the song.
# Give the user the option to exit the program.
# The title should pop up and pause along with the menu options.
# If the user chooses anything else, start again by clearing the screen.
# Use this code to get started:

# from replit import audio
# import os, time

# def play():
#   source = audio.play_file('audio.wav')
#   source.paused = False # unpause the playback
#   while True:
#     # Start taking user input and doing something with it
#     input()

# while True:
#   # clear the screen 

#   # Show the menu

#   # take user's input

#   # check whether you should call the play() subroutine depending on user's input
# Here is an example:

# ðŸŽµ MyPOD Music Player

# Press 1 to Play
# Press 2 to Exit

# Press anything else to see the menu again.
# Import your libraries first.
# With the sample code above, think about what code can be added to pause and play the audio.
# What command do you need to use to return (hint, hint) to the main menu (subroutine)?
# Create a while True loop that clears the code and pauses the code. What libraries would you need for these things to happen?
# You may also need if statements within your loop.

# Day 21 of 100 days of Python coding

# ðŸ‘‰ Day 21 Challenge
# Test your family and friends on their multiplication knowledge (or just be really mean to people you know and ask them to work out their multiplication tables for 5,474,000,000....)

# Prompt the user by asking for a multiplication table for the number of their choice.
# Generate the multiplication table for 1 to 10 times that number and ask each math fact as a question (psst...that's a hint).
# If the user gets the math correct, award them a point. If they get it wrong, do not give them any points.
# At the end of the 10 rounds, show the user their score out of 10 for how many math facts they got correct.
# Why not give users an emoji if they get all 10 math facts correct?
# Math Game!

# Name your multiples: 7

# 1 X 7 = 7
# Great work! 

# 2 X 7 = 14
# Awesome!

# 3 X 7 = 54
# Nope. The answer was 21. 

# ---

# You scored 3 out of 10.
# Use a variable when asking the user what multiplication facts they want to solve.
# Within the for loop, set up a variable, input statement, and if statements.
# Don't forget to include your counter and an if statement to say when to give a perfect score emoji.

# Day 20 of 100 days of Python coding

# What can range really do?
# Give range one number, and it will count up to that number. However, you can actually give the range function a few options...

# starting value: what number do you want to start with?
# ending value: the number after the number you want to end with (example: if you type 10 as the ending value, the computer will count until 9)
# increment: How much should it increase by every time it loops? (example: Do you want to count by 1s, 5s, 10s?)

# range(starting value,value to end before, increment)

# The ending value has an unsaid 'less than'. Meaning the computer will stop one number before the ending number that is written in the range.

# Let's try some examples.

# Let's try it out
# The first number in this range, 100, is the starting value. The second number in this range, 110, is the ending value (Remember to always put the ending number as one more than where you want to end up).

# ðŸ‘‰ What number will the code run first? What number will be last? Run the code and find out.

# for i in range(100, 110):
#   print(i)
# ðŸ‘‰ What do you expect to print with the range below? Run and find out.

# for i in range(1, 7):
#   print("Day", i)
# Did you notice that the counter stopped at 'Day 6'? Change the ending value to be one more than the last number you want shown---in this case, 8 because we want to display 7 days of the week.

# for i in range(1, 8):
#   print("Day", i)
# ðŸ‘‰ What happens when you run this code?

# print("Thirteen Times Table")
# for i in range(1, 13):
#   print(i, "x 13 =", i * 13)
# Let's add increments to our range.

# Increments
# We know that this range will start at 0 and continue to 999,999 (which is the number right before the ending value written). The number will increase in increments of 25 each time.

# ðŸ‘‰ What numbers do you expect to see? Hit run and find out.

# for i in range (0, 1000000, 25):
#   print(i)
# Counting Backward
# In this example, we are starting at 10 and counting backward to 0 (because 0 is what comes right before the ending value listed), and counting backward 1 each time.

# ðŸ‘‰ What do you expect to see when you hit run?

# for i in range(10, -1, -1):
#   print(i)

# Common Errors
# First, delete any other code in your main.py file. Copy each code snippet below into main.py by clicking the copy icon in the top right of each code box. Then, hit run and see what errors occur. Fix the errors and press run again until you are error free. Click on the ðŸ‘€ Answer to compare your code to the correct code.

# for i in range (10, 0):
#   print(i)
# The third value in the range function, increment, is missing. We need to add an increment of -1 to go backward. Without the increment written, the computer does the default of +1.

# Without the increment listed, we are telling the computer: "start at 10, keep going until 0, and add one each time." This can't be done so nothing will run unless we add an increment.

# ðŸ‘‰ Day 20 Challenge
# List Generator
# Ask the user to list a starting number, ending number, and increment to use. Display an answer based on the users' answers (use the input command.)

# Example:
# Start at: 200
# End before: 300
# Increment between values: 20

# 200
# 220
# 240
# 260
# 280
# Since you are using numbers, what else do you need to add when using input?
# Define your variables as letters that can be placeholders in the range for the user's answers.

# print("Thirteen times table")
# for i in range(1,14):
#   print(i,"x 13 =",i*13)

# print("countdown from 1,000,000")
# for i in range(1000000,0,-1):
#   print(i)

print("+++ List Generator +++")

start = int(input("What's the starting number? "))
end = int(input("What's the ending number? "))
increment = int(input("What is the increment number? "))

for i in range(start, end+1, increment):
  print(i)

#REPLIT SOLUTION
# print("Welcome to my number list generator.")
# print()
# print("You are going to give me a number you want to start with, an ending number, and by how many you want me to add each time.")
# print()

# x = int(input("What number do you want to start with? "))
# y = int(input("What number do you want to end with? "))
# z = int(input("How many should I add each time? "))

# for i in range(x, y, z):
#   print(i)

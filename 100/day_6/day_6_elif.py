#Day 6 of 100 days of Python coding

# What the elif is this?
# The elif command (which stands for 'elseif') allows you to ask 2, 3, 4 or 142 questions using the same input! This command must be in a certain place. You can have as many elif statements as you want, but they must go in between if and else and have the same indentation. The print statements in your elif command need to line up with the indent of the other print statements.
 

# Where would an elif statement go in the code below?

# print("SECURE LOGIN")
# username = input("Username > ")
# if username == "mark":
#   print("Welcome Mark!")
#   #HERE
# else:
#   print("Go away!")

# An elif statement would go in between the if and else statements.


# ðŸ‘‰ Add this elif statement to the code above. Make sure you indent properly AND put it in between the if and else statements!

# elif username == "suzanne":
#   print("Hey there Suzanne!")
 

# Your code should look like this:

# print("SECURE LOGIN")
# username = input("Username > ")

# if username == "mark":
#   print("Welcome Mark!")
# elif username == "suzanne":
#   print("Hey there Suzanne!")
# else:
#   print("Go away!")
# How easy was that? You will be a pro in no time!

# print("SECURE LOGIN")
# username = input("Username > ")
# password = input("Password > ")
# if username == "Gandalf" and password == "bestWizard":
#   print("Welcome Gandalf!")
# elif username == "Bilbo" and password == "shire1":
#   print("Hey there Bilbo!")
# elif username == "Frodo" and password == "ilovebilbo":
#   print("Greetings Frodo")
# else:
#   print("You shall not pass!")

# Common Errors

Fix the errors and press run again until you are error free. Click on the ðŸ‘€ Answer to compare your code to the correct code.

# Syntax Error
# ðŸ‘‰ What is wrong the code below?

# print("SECURE LOGIN")

# if username == "mark":
#   print("Welcome Mark!")
# else:
#   print("Go away!")
# elif username == "suzanne":
#   print("Hey there Suzanne!")
# The elif statement is in the wrong place. It must go in between the if and else statements.

# ðŸ‘‰ Day 6 Challenge
# Make your own login program.
# 1. Create a program where someone logins with their username and password correctly and then gets a lovely individual greeting.
# 2. Write a specific personalized greeting for 3 different people.
# 3. Don't forget an else statement for everyone else who shouldn't be logging in.

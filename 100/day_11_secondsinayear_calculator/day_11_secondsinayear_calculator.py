# How many seconds are in a year?
# Use the power of breaking a program down into its parts. We could Google this, but why not make a program for this instead.

# 1 minute = 60 seconds

# 60 minutes = 1 hour

# 24 hours = 1 day

# 366 day = 1 leap year (this is every four years)

# Learn more about leap years here.

# You can multiply a bunch of numbers to figure out how many seconds are in a year.
# Think about how the math would be different for a leap year.
# Use input and if statements to add the extra day for leap year.
# Think about if you need int or float for your input.

# Make the computer do all the hard work and math for you. You do the thinking beforehand.

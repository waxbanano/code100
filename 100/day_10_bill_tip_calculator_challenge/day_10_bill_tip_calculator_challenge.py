# Day 10 of 100 days of Python coding
# A little bit of math
# So far we have introduced the computer to two types of numbers:

# float: numbers with a decimal
# int: whole numbers
# ðŸ‘‰ Copy this code and have a go with trying the different mathematical symbols.

# adding = 4 + 3
# print(adding)

# subtraction = 8 - 9
# print(subtraction)

# multiplication = 4 * 32
# print(multiplication)

# division = 50 / 5
# print(division)

# # a number raised to the power of some number
# # in this example we raise 5 to the power of 2
# squared = 5**2
# print(squared)

# # remainder of a division
# modulo = 15 % 4
# print(modulo)

# # whole number division
# divisor = 15 // 2
# print(divisor)
# Fix My Code
# First, delete any other code in your main.py file. Copy each code snippet below into main.py by clicking the copy icon in the top right of each code box. Follow the directions written in green.

# ðŸ‘‰ # Solve the following problems with my code
# # Your goal is to print the solution of all 3 calculations to the screen.

# # multiplication
# print("3.4*6.8 =",3.4 * 6.8)

# # # division
# print("2467/4673 =",2467 / 4673)

# # #raise 10 to the power of 2
# print("10**2 =",10**2)

# # # print the remainder when 343 is divided by 4
# print("343//100 =",343 // 100)

# Let's split the bill
# Did you have fun messing with those mathematical symbols? Now let's put them to good use.

# You and your friends went to dinner and need to split the bill. Being the clever friend you are, you can use your code to discover how much each person owes. (Remember, myBill is a float because the total bill will probably have a decimal point and numberOfPeople is an int because you did not go to dinner with .7 of a person.)

# ðŸ‘‰ Copy this code and see what happens:

# myBill = float(input("What was the bill?: "))
# numberOfPeople = int(input("How many people?: "))
# answer = myBill / numberOfPeople
# print("You all owe", answer)
# Did you get a really funky number with sooo many decimal points?

# You can take your answer and use round. Round has two components: "What am I rounding?" and "How many decimal places am I rounding to?"

# Add this portion of code after answer and before print. This shows you are rounding answer to 2 decimal points.

# answer = round(answer, 2)

# myBill = float(input("What was the bill?: "))
# numberOfPeople = int(input("How many people were in the party?: "))
# answer = myBill / numberOfPeople
# answer = round(answer, 2)
# print("You all owe", answer)

# ðŸ‘‰ Day 10 Challenge
# Extend your bill calculator
# Add a tip function that adds the total tip to the bill before splitting it equally between the people.

# 1.Ask the user for the total bill amount.
# 2.Ask what % of tip they will leave to be added to the bill total.
# HINT - Typically, a tip is either 15%, 18% or 20% of the total bill.

# 3.Figure out how to get the total bill with tip then add that to original amount. HINT - Divide the tip percentage by 100, and multiply that to the total bill amount BEFORE adding that to the original amount.
# Divide the tip percentage by 100, and multiply that to the total bill amount BEFORE adding that to the original amount.
# Ask the user how many people are splitting the bill and divide by the total.
# You can use the same code to get started:

# myBill = float(input("What was the bill?: "))
# numberOfPeople = int(input("How many people?: "))
# answer = myBill / numberOfPeople
# print("You all owe", answer)

print("== Bill  Calculator ==")
bill = float(input("what was the bill?"))
tip = float(input("what % of would you like added to the bill total?"))
people = int(input("how many people?"))
tipPercent = tip/100
tipAmount = tipPercent*bill
billWithTip = bill+tipAmount
splitBill = billWithTip/people
print(bill,"bill")
print(tipPercent,"tipPercent")
print(tipAmount,"tipAmount")
print(billWithTip,"billWithTip")
print(splitBill,"per person")

#REPLIT SOLUTION
myBill = float(input("What was the bill?: "))
numberOfPeople = int(input("How many people?: "))
tip = int(input("What percent tip do you want to leave: 15, 18, or 20 percent?"))


bill_with_tip = tip / 100 * myBill + myBill
bill_per_person = bill_with_tip / numberOfPeople
final_amount = round(bill_per_person, 2)


print("You all owe", final_amount)

#Day 1 of 100 days of Python coding

#HINT - 'If you want to feel like a proper hacker, when you've finished writing your code hit `CMD + Enter` to run your code!'

#HINT - Use the triple quote """ if you want to write a big chunk of text with gaps or line breaks.

#ERORRS#

# NameError
# You'll see this error message if:
# you get the name of a function wrong
# you misspell it
# get the capitalization wrong

# Print("What could go wrong?")

# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "main.py", line 1, in <module>
#     Print("What could go wrong?")
# NameError: name 'Print' is not defined

# Did you notice the p in print is capitalized? print is only lower case letters.


#SyntaxError#
#
# You will see this message if:
# you have the order of the symbols wrong
# you forget () or " "
#
#print "Hello Again"
#
#   File "main.py", line 1
#     print "Hello Again"
#           ^
# SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print("Hello Again")?

#FIX MY CODE - DAY 1#

#BAD CODE
# print("= MUSIC+ =")
# print("> Songs")
# print("> Albums")
# print("> Artists")

# FIXED CODE
# print("= MUSIC+ =")
# print("> Songs")
# print("> Albums")
# print("> Artists")

#CHALLENGE - DAY1#

# 1. Write your full name and today's date in separate lines of code. HINT - Don't forget "" and () when creating your print statements.

# 1.
print("Your Full Name")
print("Today's Date")

# 2.Copy this text below. See if you can do it with just the one print statement! HINT - Remember you can use triple quotes for a large block of text. """

# 2.
print("""Your Full Name \nToday's Date""")

# 3. On the next line add I am feeling with an emoji of your choice to illustrate how you're feeling about the challenge. HINT - When using Unicode with Python, replace "+" with "000" from the Unicode. And then prefix the Unicode with "\". For example- U+1F913 will be used as \U0001F913. Here, "+" is replaced with "000" and "\" is prefixed with the Unicode.
# 3.
print("I am feeling smart \U0001F913")

# 4.Add one more line to your output You can follow my progress at replit.com/@ and add in your Replit username. This will be a great way of maintaining accountability for yourself!

# 4.Add one more line to your output You can follow my progress at replit.com/@ and add in your Replit username. This will be a great way of maintaining accountability for yourself!

#Day 29 of 100 days of Python coding
# Secret One: end
# You can already create print statements like a boss, but there are a few things you can do to make them easier.

# Let's add a few secret second arguments to the print statement and see what happens.

# By default, at the end of every print statement, the computer clicks 'enter'.

# ðŸ‘‰ Remember, how a range of numbers shows each number on a new line...

# for i in range(0, 100):
#   print(i)


# Add a space
# ðŸ‘‰ Let's tweak that code and see if we can get it to print with a space between each number instead of a new line. What do you notice?

# for i in range(0, 100):
#   print(i, end=" ")
# Add a space and comma
# ðŸ‘‰ What if we want to add a comma and a space? Let's try it by adding , to our argument.

# for i in range(0, 100):
#   print(i, end=", ")
# Now this looks like a proper list!

# Add a new line, tab, or vertical tab
# ðŸ‘‰ What happens if you add these different options in your second argument? Play around with these options below and see what they do:

# #new line
# for i in range(0, 100):
#   print(i, end="\n")
# #tab indent
# for i in range(0, 100):
#   print(i, end="\t")
# #vertical tab
# for i in range(0, 100):
#   print(i, end="\v")
# Play around with end. What can it do?

for i in range(0, 100):
  print(i, end=" ")

# Secret Two: sep
# (Wait...why are we still using end when this chapter is about secret two, sep? Just hold tight...)

# Color Changing with end...
# ðŸ‘‰ I can turn the colors on and off different bits of the code by using end. Remove the previous code from your main.py file and try this out.

# print("If you put")
# print("\033[33m", end="") #yellow
# print("nothing as the")
# print("\033[35m", end="") #purple
# print("end character")
# print("\033[32m", end="") #green
# print("then you don't")
# print("\033[0m", end="") #default
# print("get odd gaps")
# ðŸ‘‰ Let's concatenate that same print statement:

# print("If you put", "\033[33m", "nothing as the", "\033[35m", "end character", "\033[32m", "then you don't", "\033[0m", "get odd gaps", end="")
# Now you may notice that we are getting weird double spaces in between the different sections. Let's fix that!

# Color changing with sep...
# ðŸ‘‰ Take this same code and change end to sep (short for separator) and add a space at the end of each string. What happens?

# print("If you put ", "\033[33m", "nothing as the ", "\033[35m", "end character ", "\033[32m", "then you don't ", "\033[0m", "get odd gaps ", sep="")


# This is a much easier way to control spacing in random text or emojis too!

# Secret Three: Cursor
# David, you muppet! Why are we doing this again? We already learned this...

# ðŸ‘‰ Do you notice how difficult this is to read?

# import os

# for i in range(1, 101):
#   print(i)
#   os.system("clear")
# Your probably thinking...David, import time:

# ðŸ‘‰ Let's do it, but is there anything you still notice?

# import os, time

# for i in range(1, 101):
#   print(i)
#   time.sleep(0.5)
#   os.system("clear")
# That GIANT white cursor...
# I bet you didn't even know we could turn that off! It is just a sneaky print command.



# ðŸ‘‰ Let's try the same code, but turn the cursor off:

# import os, time
# print('\033[?25l', end="")
# for i in range(1, 101):
#   print(i)
#   time.sleep(0.2)
#   os.system("clear")
# What if we want to turn the cursor back on:

# ðŸ‘‰ Day 29 Challenge
# Write a subroutine that writes text in color. All it will do is print out the text in that color and turn the color back to normal when it's finished.

# Control end and sep so there are not random symbols or spaces.

# Check out this github resource for the color codes.
# https://gist.github.com/rene-d/9e584a7dd2935d0f461904b9f2950007

# Example:



# Create a subroutine with a variable for 'word' and 'color' through the use of if statements. Here is an example of how to include the color red:
#  if color=="red":
#     print("\033[31m", word, sep="", end="")
# print your title 'Super Subroutine' and 'with my' as regular print statements.
# print the rest of the text in different colors by calling the subroutine.

def newPrint(color, word):
  if color=="red":
    print("\033[31m", word, sep="", end="")
  elif color=="green":
    print("\033[32m", word, sep="", end="")
  elif color=="blue":
    print("\033[34m", word, sep="", end="")
  else:
    print("\033[0m", word, sep="", end="")

print("Super Subroutine")
print("With my ", end="")
newPrint("red", "new program")
newPrint("reset", " I can just call red('and') ")
newPrint("red", "it will print in red ")
newPrint("blue", "or even blue")
